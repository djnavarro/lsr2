Rethinking the `lsr` package that accompanies [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com). In the original book, the goal of the package was to provide a few convenient wrapper functions and simplifications that novice users might find handy. A typical reader of the book might be psychology undergraduate students who encountering R, statistics and programming for the first time, and I found the simplifications useful in some cases. The `tidylsr` package is intended to accompany the next version of *Learning Statistics with R*, in which the goal is to teach a tidyverse-focused data analysis pipeline. It's very much a work in progress
