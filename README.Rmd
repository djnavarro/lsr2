[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/djnavarro/lsr2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/djnavarro/lsr2)  [![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/djnavarro/lsr2/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/djnavarro/lsr2?branch=master)

Rethinking the `lsr` package that accompanies [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com). In the original book, the goal of the package was to provide a few convenient wrapper functions and simplifications that novice users might find handy. A typical reader of the book might be psychology undergraduate students who encountering R, statistics and programming for the first time, and I found the simplifications useful in some cases. The `lsr2` package (working title!) is intended to accompany the next version of *Learning Statistics with R*, in which the goal is to teach a tidyverse-focused data analysis pipeline. It's very much a work in progress
